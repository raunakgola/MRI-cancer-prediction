# MRI-Cancer Prediction Using Deep Learning and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3DConv) in PyTorch
## Project Overview
### This project aims to predict cancerous regions in MRI scans using deep learning techniques, specifically 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3DConv) implemented in PyTorch. By analyzing volumetric data from MRI scans, the model can detect and classify cancerous regions with improved accuracy compared to traditional 2D approaches.

## Features
3D Convolutional Neural Network: Utilizes 3DConv layers to process volumetric MRI data.
Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization, resizing, and augmentation techniques.
Model Evaluation: Provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Tools for visualizing the results, including the predicted regions of interest in MRI scans.
## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Other dependencies as listed in requirements.txt

## Installation
### Clone the repository:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MRI-cancer-prediction.git
cd MRI-cancer-prediction
Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data Preparation
Data Source: The MRI data used in this project should be in a 3D format (e.g., NIfTI, DICOM).

## Preprocessing: Run the preprocessing script to normalize and resize the MRI images to a consistent shape:

python preprocess_data.py --data_dir path_to_data --output_dir path_to_output
Dataset Structure: Ensure that your data is structured as follows:
data/
├── train/
│   ├── cancer/
│   └── healthy/
└── test/
    ├── cancer/
    └── healthy/
    
## Training the Model
Adjust the model parameters and hyperparameters in config.py.

Start training:
python train.py --data_dir path_to_preprocessed_data --epochs 50 --batch_size 16
Monitor the training process through the logs generated.

## Evaluation
After training, evaluate the model on the test set:
python evaluate.py --model_path path_to_trained_model --data_dir path_to_test_data
The evaluation script will output accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Inference
To perform inference on new MRI scans:
python predict.py --model_path path_to_trained_model --input_image path_to_mri_image

## Visualization
You can visualize the results using the provided visualize.py script:

python visualize.py --input_image path_to_mri_image --output_image path_to_save_visualization
Results
This section provides the results of the model, including performance metrics and visualizations of predictions.
